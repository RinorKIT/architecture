# Quality Requirements {#section-quality-scenarios}
As breifly mentioned in the 'Introduction and Goals' section, there are quality goals, we want to achieve in the FullStaQD reference architecture. 
In this section, we want to describe these goals in more detail and want to present some scenarios, in which they are needed.

## Quality Requirements Overview {#_quality_requirements_overview}
We sort the quality requirements after the arc42 design (https://quality.arc42.org/qualities/). Afterwards, we present the scenarios that can appear in the reference architecture, and we define which quality goal needs to be fulfilled in each scenario.

### Efficient

| Quality Goal  | Description | Scenario ID |
| ------------- | ------------- |  ------------- | 
| Capacity  | System meets requirements for the maximum limits of system parameter.  | |
| Coherence    | Logically or aesthetically ordered or integrated  | SC1 |
| Cohesion  | In computer programming, cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.  | |
| Compliance  | How well does the system or product obeys the rules of a given standard.  | |
| Conciseness | Giving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but comprehensive.  | SC1 |
| Determinism  | Determinism means that under the same inputs and initial conditions, a system produces the same externally observable behavior. This is foundational for reproducible testing, debugging, formal reasoning, and fault-tolerant replication.  | |
| Distributability  | In software engineering, distributability refers to the ease with which a system’s components can be distributed across multiple physical or virtual locations, platforms, or computing nodes while maintaining functionality, performance, and reliability. A highly distributable system enables workload distribution, geographic deployment flexibility, and the ability to partition functionality across heterogeneous environments.  | SC4  |

| Changeability  |  the system can rapidly be changed. | SC2, SC3, SC5, SC8 |
| Co-existence  | Capability of a product to perform its required functions efficiently while sharing a common environment and resources with other products, without detrimental impact on any other product (with other stacks) | SC8 |
| Composability  | Composability is a system design principle that deals with the inter-relationships of components. A highly composable system provides components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.    |  |
| Configurability | Configurability refers to the ability of a system, software application, or hardware device to be easily customized and adapted to suit various requirements, preferences, and environments. A configurable system allows users or administrators to modify its settings, features, or behavior without the need for extensive code changes or hardware modifications. Configurability empowers users to tailor the system to their specific needs, making it more versatile and adaptable. | SC2, SC3, SC4, SC8 |

| Extensibility  | Ability to add new features or functions to a system.  | SC2, SC3, SC4  |
| Flexibility  | Applies to several stages in the life of a system or product, for example: at development or compile time, installation or deployment time, during testing at runtime  | |
| Independence  | Functional independence is achieved by developing functions that perform only one kind of task and do not excessively interact with other modules. Independence is important because it makes implementation more accessible and faster. The independent modules are easier to maintain, test, and reduce error propagation and can be reused in other programs as well. Thus, functional independence is a good design feature which ensures software quality.  | |
| Integrability  | Integrability is the ease with which a software component or system can be integrated with other components or systems.  | SC2, SC3, SC4, SC8|

It is closely related to but distinct from:  Observability: raw signals (logs, metrics, traces) vs. using those signals effectively to debug. Testability: how easily a system can be tested vs. how easily failures can be diagnosed. Analysability: impact/change assessment; debuggability emphasizes incident and defect diagnosis| |
| Maintainability  | Maintainability is concerned with modifications after the software baseline is established. The goal of a maintenance activity is to correct defects, adapt to changing environments, or im- prove a system’s future maintainability or other quality attributes. The description of a particular maintenance activity is in the eye of the beholder: A particular change (or type of change) can be labeled differently, depending on the maintainer’s intention. We measure maintainability as the amount of work required to modify, test, and maintain our software base in response to changes in environmental elements. This measure may depend on who is perform- ing the maintenance task and that individual’s level of skill or knowledge. | |
| Modularity  | Capability of a product to limit changes to one component from affecting other components. (Backend)  | |
| Updateability  | Updateability refers to the capability of a software system to efficiently receive, install, and integrate updates, patches, security fixes, and minor enhancements while maintaining system integrity and minimizing service disruption. | SC5 |
